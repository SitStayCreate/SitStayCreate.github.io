                <p>
                    This is a hard fork of the serialosc server. We like puns and wordgames here, so we'll call it a soft spoon of CerealOSC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CerealOSC is a Java Swing app that acts as a bridge between applications designed for grid controllers that communicate over MIDI.
                    It also provides the ability to create virtual grids that respond to mouse clicks. The goal of CerealOSC is to provide an entry point 
                    for anyone curious about electronic music or programming to try building their own instrument.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Navigate to <a href="https://github.com/SitStayCreate/midiosc">https://github.com/SitStayCreate/midiosc</a> and download the JAR file located
                    there. CerealOSC is a Java application that requires Java 8 to run. Please download the JRE if you do not already have it installed on your machine.
                    You can find this at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/">Oracle.com</a>

                    <p>
                        Electronic music is very different from many other styles of music. The barrier to entry is mostly financial and anyone can make compelling
                        music at home. Instead of needing lessons for years as you might with an acoustic instrument, the focus is more on creating short vignettes
                        and looping them. Pedants might debate me on this and they aren't wrong, but this isn't a website for them. It's a website for everyone else.
                        Absolute truths are rarely useful when discussing things that are outside of the realm of hard science; approximate truths are sometimes better
                        in applied sciences and arts. This is to say that practical knowledge often limits the scope in which it is discussed to keep the context manageable.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-center">CerealOSC</h3>
                    <p>
                        Grid controllers are usually midi devices that communicate via USB. However, there are other apps that may use other protocols, such as OSC.
                        OSC (open sound control) was created as an alternative to the MIDI protocol and is instead a network protocol. In order for a midi device
                        to communicate with these apps, we need a third app to act as a translator or bridge. CerealOSC is designed to act as a bridge for midi controllers
                        to use OSC based applications.
                    </p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Midi to OSC adapter</h3>
                <div class="my-3">
                    <img src="./static/images/midiosc/midiosc-ssc.png" class="home-card-image img-fluid d-block mx-auto">
                </div>
                <p>
                    To create a virtual OSC device, first select your MIDI controller from the dropdown menus in CerealOSC. The MIDI in dropdown menu chooses
                    the device that will be sending MIDI data to CerealOSC. The MIDI out dropdown menu selects the device that will be receiving MIDI data from
                    CerealOSC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, select the port you would like CerealOSC to use to receive messages from external apps. Please note, some ports are reserved and may not
                    be used. Please also note, a port may only be opened by one virtual OSC device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, select the dimensions for your MIDI controller and click create. You currently can choose from an 8x8 grid or a 16x8 grid. The checkbox
                    labeled Invert Y-Axis sets the orientation of your controller. Regular orientation in this case is 0-63/127 starting at the top left corner and
                    ending at the bottom right corner. Inverted orientation, then, starts at the bottom left corner and ends at the top right corner. APC Mini
                    controllers have inverted orientation, while the Pads object in Lemur has regular orientation, for example.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-center">Virtual grid</h3>
                <div class="my-3">
                    <img src="./static/images/midiosc/midiosc-1.1.0(2).png" class="home-card-image img-fluid d-block mx-auto">
                </div>
                <p>
                    As of CerealOSC 1.1.0, you also can create a virtual grid if you don't have a midi controller and still want to build your own app.
                    This was something we built to prototype apps on different machines and for others to be able to collaborate without investing in hardware.
                    The short demo video at the top of this page is using this feature with an app named Meadowphysics for Max 7.

                    This is to say, at the moment, this is as far as we plan on going with this project. We have released the source code under a GPL3 license, so feel free to modify
                    it yourself. Also, lastly, I want to thank everyone who has worked on the JavaOSC library (Illposed, hoijui, etc).
                    This library is well-designed, well-maintained, and easy to use.
