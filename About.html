                        SitStayCreate is an example of why we can't have nice things. Trans owned and operated, this website
                        was the target of harrassment and cyberbullying for no reason. I literally made free stuff for you to
                        enjoy using and was repaid in the worst ways. I even provided free support for the software I wrote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the software I wrote is still available, I am going to be making a few tweaks in the coming
                        weeks/months/as time and my mental health permit. Consider this a hard fork of serialosc. We like
                        puns and wordgames here, so we'll call it a soft spoon of CerealOSC.

                        No longer SitStayCreate and disillusioned with the electronic music scene (Read as: I finally 
                        understand what is meant by the male-gaze and I'm disgusted. This is not to say that men are bad.
                        There are a lot of great cishet men in my life that are wonderful parents who have been here for me.
                        I will not tolerate man-bashing here any more than I tolerate any sort of bullying) I have decided
                        I need to move into a new direction. My target audience is 35+, probably hella gay, and I do not 
                        intend to make commercial products. If I do, it is purely accidental.

                        When I was young, there was the underground music scene. It wasn't exactly anything goes, but it
                        was able to cover a wider range of topics than the modern lowest-common-denominator 
                        must-be-marketable-internationally immediately-available-for-everyone music scenes of today.
                        Not everyone wants to be famous and most of us probably shouldn't be given that level of attention.
                        *Raises both hands in surrender*.

                        This used to exist in boutique record stores and later on blogs run by "taste makers." Anecdotaly,
                        these were mostly trust-fund adolescents/young adults who had the privilege to spend their time picking 
                        who was and wasn't cool. Nowadays we have industry plants labeled as "influencers" that create content 
                        for the mostly consolidated market of internet platforms. I don't care really and am not here to change
                        the world, I'm here to reclaim a space for those who aren't comfortable in the spotlight, with an emphasis
                        on safety.

                        I am McGnars herself and this is the Magic Ohno Show. Welcome to the free-k show. Where non-neurotypicals
                        are celebrated, where no one needs to feel discriminated against, and where everyone is welcome, but most
                        will be confused. My genre is fixed-edge (like straight edge, but we broke it and glued it back together).
                    </p>

                        Longevity is the name of the game here, not as in having long careers, but as in I need a creative outlet
                        and will focus on maintaining that as a priority over what's fashionable. Some of you will be disappointed
                        by the low-quality, but many of you don't remember DIY or LoFi during their hey-days (I was a tween and 
                        pimply teen at the tail-end of these genres). This is a project like Built to Spill where I will put on
                        my friends, but do not promise a constant line-up. The music is probably going to be worse than you expect,
                        but that's all part of the show. The sonic equivalent of backyard wrestling without the arthritis and 
                        herniated disks.

                        Since I like the written word and think there isn't enough of plain-talking new-sincerity outlets and 
                        because I know many people who are smarter than I am, I hope to also maintain a diy FreeZine. It will
                        not be released periodically, but instead as time permits and relevant topics present themselves. This
                        is a place for healing, an oasis in the otherwise polluted and overly-politicized web full of hot-takes.
